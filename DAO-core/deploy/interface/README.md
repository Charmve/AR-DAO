## JSON Interface

This directory contains 2 versions of the interface with which to interact with the DAO. One is the full DAO generate by the Solidity compiler and the other one is a minimal one containing only the minimum amount of functions that a simple user would want in order to interact with the DAO.

To link to them from an html webpage all one has to do is wrap the
file's URL like below:
```
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/slockit/DAO/tree/master/deploy/interface/minimal.json"></script>
```

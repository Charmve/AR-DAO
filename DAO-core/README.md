[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slockit/DAO.png)](https://travis-ci.org/slockit/DAO)

## What is it?

Note: this is currently not maintained - do not use it as is.

A Standard Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) framework written in Solidity to run on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Feel free to reuse this framework to create your own Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

## Disclaimer

The future remains a work in progress. Our vision exists in a world where laws vary widely. It is important to remember that anyone who uses the generic DAO framework including the DAO refered to as 'The DAO' or any other DAO will do so at their own risk. One can only speculate about the legal status of DAOs worldwide. Whatever one’s personal beliefs may be, people must draw their own conclusions, relying on legal advice where appropriate. The authors are not a law firm and are not in the business of offering legal advice.

**If you create a DAO it will be your DAO, and you will be responsible for its operation.**






## Overview

Our Standard DAO Framework allows people to create Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) governed by the code in this repository written immutably to the blockchain.

We are making the Standard DAO Framework we developed free and open source, so it can be reused by anyone wishing to put together a transparent organization where governance and decision making systems are immutably programmed in the Ethereum blockchain. This code been reviewed by hundreds of pairs of eyes from our community and by one of the most respected auditing companies in the world, Deja Vu.

This DAO model is open source under the LGPL, so it can be reused by anyone wishing to put together a transparent organization where governance and decision making system are immutably programmed in the Blockchain.

Note: Although the word "contract" is used in the DAO’s framework code, the term is a programming convention and is not being used as a legal term of art. The term is a programming convention, not a representation that the code is in and of itself a legally binding and enforceable contract. If you have questions about legal enforceability, consult with legal counsel.






## Solidity files

### DAO.sol:
Standard smart contract for any generated Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to automate organizational governance and decision-making.

### Token.sol: 
Defines the functions to check token balances, send tokens, send tokens on behalf of a 3rd party and its corresponding approval process.

### TokenCreation.sol: 
Token Creation contract, used by the DAO generated by the framework to sell its tokens and initialize its ether.

### SampleOffer.sol
Sample Proposal from a Contractor to the DAO generated by the framework. Feel free to use as a template for your own proposal.

### ManagedAccount.sol
Basic account, used by the DAO contract generated by the framework to separately manage both the rewards and the extraBalance accounts. 

### DAOTokenCreationProxyTransferer.sol
This contract is used as a fall back in case an exchange doesn't implement the "add data to a transaction" feature in a timely manner, preventing it from calling createTokenProxy().
